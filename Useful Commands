#TCPDUMP utility

Show interfaces on a box
 ``` tcpdump -D ```

Listen on specific interface
      tcpdump -i eth0

Find packets for a specific address
      tcpdump -i em1  | grep "239.31.82.79"

Do not convert address to names 
      tcpdump -i em1 -nnn | grep "239.31.82.79"

Disable promiscuous mode. (allows a NIC to receive all traffic on the network, even if it is not addressed to this NIC)
      tcpdump -i em1 -nnn -p | grep "239.31.82.79"

Print packet in ASCII
      tcpdump -A -i eth0

Dump packet to a file
      tcpdump -w file.pcap -i eth0

Capture packets with readable timestamp
      tcpdump -ttt -i eth0

Receive packet flow on a particular port
      tcpdump -i eth0 port 22001

Receive packet flow for particular destination host and port
      tcpdump -i eth0 dst 239.31.82.79 and port 22001
